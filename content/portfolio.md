### London Calling

The [London Calling website](https://london-calling.org.uk/) collates the latest opportunities from partners for London's not-for-profits, all in one place. London Calling is an initiative of Resource for London and London Plus, funded by City Bridge Foundation. The aim is to help connect London's thousands of charities to relevant events, training, and funding opportunities taking place across the capital.

Good With Data developed a bespoke approach that scrapes data from partner websites and employs generative AI to classify and enhance this information. Our methodology includes partner consent and support for the project. 

**Key Technologies Used:**
- Web scraping and data collection
- Generative AI for content classification
- Data processing and enhancement

**Impact:**
- Connecting thousands of London charities to opportunities
- Enhanced discoverability of sector events, funding and training
